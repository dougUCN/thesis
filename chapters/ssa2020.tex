%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Measurements took place in 2020. Initial version of \acrshort{ssa} was tested. All measurements are flow through measurements from source to spin analyzer

\section{Description of apparatus}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Same polarizer, \BZnS scintillator , iron yoke design. Mounted on a free switcher port. Other port had the single arm.

\section{Measurements}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To limit the impact on the UCN source, used these beam parameters: 

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------------------------------
beam parameters for the nEDM test measurements
capture H-Gx: 77%
countdown: 1---> 8
pattern width: 327
9 pulses per burst
4.975 s between bursts
---------------------------------------------------
Average current = 1 micro-A

This should lower the current by a factor of 10.

\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Beam continuously on. North gate valve toggled on and off every 30 seconds to allow detectors to drain (and avoid cross talk influencing the next step). Counting integration period is the middle 20 seconds of the 30 second NGV open stage to avoid the spike of neutrons when gate opens.

\section{Discussion}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Observe that as neutrons get rejected from one arm, the other arm sees increased counts 

Flow through measurement of single arm for comparison in Fig.~\ref{fig:spin_flipper_efficiency}. (Minimum at 0.12. Asymmetry = 0.8). Fig.~\ref{fig:Fall2020_SSA_RF_east}, for RF ON, Amp=1.4 V at 34 kHz, minimum at 0.21, Asymmetry = 0.65. Fig.~\ref{fig:Fall2020_SSA_RF_east}, for RF ON, Amp=1.4 V at 34 kHz, minimum at 0.17, Asymmetry = 0.69.

If gradient is small resonance is narrow, because B0 must match B1 on RF for adiabaticity

Check chances of a rejected on one arm being depolarized and allowed through the other arm. Fig.~\ref{fig:SSA_asym_one_foil_out}. Asymmetry at 34 kHz East is 0.68. At West is 0.73, not particularly meaningful.

Wound RF coils with higher coil count and removed aluminum sleeve which might attenuate things (outer aluminum housing anyway).

Increased guide drop with NiP coated segment. For comparison, beneath the elbow, the single arm channel has a drop of \qty{39}{in} to the iron yoke.

New power supply with higher amplitude. keithley 6517b
