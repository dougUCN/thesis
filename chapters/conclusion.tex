List accomplishments of the experiment

Describe next steps for trouble shooting T1. Flow through measurement past MSR is planned with a new single channel spin analyzer. Degaussing loop contacts should be fixed by summer 2023. May replace the switcher wye. Continued characterization of the B0 and transport coil and improvement of the magnetic impurity scanner.

Cell valve actuating arm on the top cell has been redesigned and corrected.

High voltage feed through designed and will be tested

Mercury development ongoing



An in-situ cell valve monitoring method is being implemented, where a gauge reads the pressure in the hydraulic line. When the piston outside of the MSR exerts pressure on a closed cell valve, assuming there is no leak in the line, the pressure spikes above the baseline pressure.
