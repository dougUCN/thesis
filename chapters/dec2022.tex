Fill time sweep. Normalized to West gate valve. Trying to see if that helps UCN counts (it does not)

Load against the closed cell valve to try to see if neutrons get lost there. Then immediately turn the switcher and check guide dump counts are $4350(65)$.

    {\textbf{(\subref{subfig:2022_single_arm_eff})} Single arm spin flipper efficiency as a function of the RF frequency measured on the North beamline in 2022. The count rate on the y-axis is normalized to the West Gate valve monitor, then divided by the baseline count rate with the spin flipper off. For $\text{Amp}=\qty{10}{Vpp}$, the minimum at \qty{20}{kHz} is 0.28. \textbf{(\subref{subfig:2022_single_arm_asym})} The same data replotted in terms of asymmetry}

Tuning spin flipper (see Fig.~) in flow through mode. Note the contrast and asymmetry

Comparison of various configurations of holding field coils of single arm vs polarizer in vs out to see how many UCN we are missing. Same procedure each time, with a \qty{100}{s} preload against the NGV, before opening and flowing directly through the lower switcher to spin analyzer. Upper switcher set to beam height detector. Normalized the WGV as usual.

Make a table!!

Foil out: \qty{3404(24)}{UCN\per s}. Beam height: \qty{3657(26)}{UCN\per s}

Foil in (holding field coils OFF): \qty{2747(20)}{UCN\per s}. Beam height: \qty{3836(28)}{UCN\per s}

Foil in (holding field coils nominal): \qty{2744(20)}{UCN\per s}. \qty{3825(28)}{UCN\per s}

Refer to simulation. Can be any number of issues. Transport coils into the MSR. Magnetized components that are saturated on the beamline.
