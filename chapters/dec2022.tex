Load against the closed cell valve to try to see if neutrons get lost there. Then immediately turn the switcher and check guide dump counts are $4350(65)$.

For $\text{Amp}=\qty{10}{Vpp}$, the minimum at \qty{20}{kHz} is 0.28. \textbf{(\subref{subfig:2022_single_arm_asym})} The same data replotted in terms of asymmetry}

\end{figure}

Tuning spin flipper (see Fig.~) in flow through mode. Note the contrast and asymmetry. Upper switcher pointed at detector

Comparison of various configurations of holding field coils of single arm vs polarizer in vs out to see how many UCN we are missing. Same procedure each time, with a \qty{100}{s} preload against the NGV, before opening and flowing directly through the lower switcher to spin analyzer. Upper switcher set to beam height detector. Normalized the WGV as usual.

Make a table!!

Foil out: \qty{3404(24)}{UCN\per s}. Beam height: \qty{3657(26)}{UCN\per s}

Foil in (holding field coils OFF): \qty{2747(20)}{UCN\per s}. Beam height: \qty{3836(28)}{UCN\per s}

Foil in (holding field coils nominal): \qty{2744(20)}{UCN\per s}. \qty{3825(28)}{UCN\per s}

\section{Asymmetry measurements}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

100s preload, 50s fill, 30s storage. RF doublet pairs, toggling every 10 - 15 seconds depending on the run. Second integration period typically shorter, so worse statistics

{Measured asymmetry $A_i$ for various configurations of the $B_0$ and transport coils. $i$ refers to the integration period during the cell dump period for which the asymmetry is calculated. The currents applied to the outer $B_0$ coils (the top 2 and bottom 2 octagons), $B_0$ coils (the middle 4 octagons), and the transport coils are listed.

Refer to simulation. Can be any number of issues. Transport coils into the MSR. Magnetized components that are saturated on the beamline.
