% This thesis would not have been possible without the support of many, many people. I am especially grateful for the mentorship and support of my PhD advisor, Chen-Yu Liu. Thank you for always being there when I needed help, for stopping my pessimism from spiraling out of control when difficulties arose, for teaching me how to think creatively and critically, and for giving me confidence in my own abilities.

% I have too many people to thank for their support during my time at Los Alamos National Lab. Thank you Takeyasu Ito for sharing so much of your knowledge, for working so patiently with me, and for always being available to answer my endless questions. Thank you Wade Uhrich for always going out of your way to help me. Thank you Steve Clayton, Mark Makela, and Chris O'Shaughnessy for the many hours of troubleshooting assistance and for helping me to learn from my many mistakes. It truly was a pleasure to work with everyone.

% I would also like to thank my undergraduate mentors, Steve Lamoreaux and Andy Saunders, for nurturing my interests and pointing me towards UCN physics. My thanks as well to Josh Long for his guidance during my early years in graduate school.

% To my friends, thank you. I am not sure I would have made it through without them picking me up whenever I stumbled. To Daniel Winney and Jonathan Gutierrez, thank you for braving the trenches of graduate school alongside me. To Kevin Yeh and Wesley Lu, thank you for putting up with a weirdo like me for all these years and for lending an ear whenever I needed to talk. 

% Most of all, I am thankful for the members of my beloved family: Mom, Dad, and Kim. Thank you for being a constant bedrock of support in my life. I know I can always rely on you.
