% The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiment that is currently being developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) will use ultracold neutrons (UCN) and Ramseyâ€™s method of separated oscillatory fields to search for a nEDM with a statistical uncertainty of 2 x 10^{-27} e cm in 5 calendar years of running. Measurements and analysis of the data taken during the commissioning of the experiment and experimental beamline are presented.  A description of the developed LANL nEDM experiment control and data acquisition systems is provided. Monte Carlo simulations of UCN transport from the LANL UCN source into the experimental apparatus and an analytical model describing storage of polarized UCN are also discussed.
