The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiment that is currently being developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) will use ultracold neutrons (UCN) and Ramseyâ€™s method of separated oscillatory fields to search for a nEDM with a statistical uncertainty of $\num{2.71e-27} e\,\text{cm (}90\%\text{ C.L.)}$ in 5 calendar years of running. This dissertation presents the following: (1) a description of the LANL nEDM experiment, control systems, and data acquisition, (2) measurements and analysis of data taken during the commissioning of experimental components and the UCN beamline, (3) an analytical model that provides a simple parameterization of
the input UCN energy spectrum on the beamline, and (4) Monte Carlo simulations of UCN transport from the LANL UCN source into the experimental apparatus.
